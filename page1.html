        <p>The beginning of 10th grade was great, it felt like a step up from being a freshman. It gave me a chance to feel better about myself and be close to done with highschool. It taught me what it was like to not have to care
            much about what I presented to other people.
        </p>
        <p>All the concerts I went to were great. They were an oppurtunity for me to let go and not have to worry about school work or what I was going to do tommorow or even the day after that.</p>
        <p>When the first semester finally ended, it led to a time where my friends and I could hang out and not worry for a long time about what our grades were. It was a very relaxing time. </p>
        <p>Once I finished the 3rd quarter, I felt the school year coming to a close, I was so ready for it to be over and to just be done with my teachers.</p>
        <p>Finally, since school is all over for the year, I can just calm down, and hang out with friends even though quarantine is happening right now which kind of sucks</p>
