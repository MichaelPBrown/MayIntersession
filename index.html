      <li>Starting of 10th Grade</li>

      <p>Both of these were great for me because I was able to meet new friends and learn new things as I went.</p>

      <li>Meeting some of my favourite muscial artists</li>
      <li>Lake Tahoe with family and friends</li>
    </ul>
<p> These events were important because I got go advice with all of them, as the second half rolled in I got advice from friends in different schools on how to not fall behind of work. I also got good advice from the artists
  because they told me what they did to get where they did.<br> And at Lake Tahoe it was just a couple weeks of fun with everybody.

          <ul>
      <li>Last quarter</li>
      <li>Quarantine</li>
    </ul>
      <p>These effected me in different ways, the ending of the year made me feel really good, but also made me realize how close I am to being done with highschool. Quarantine just gave me a time to relax and get ready for the next year.</p>
