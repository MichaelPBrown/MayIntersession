      <li>Meeting some of my favourite muscial artists</li>

<p> These events were important because I got go advice with all of them, as the second half rolled in I got advice from friends in different schools on how to not fall behind of work. I also got good advice from the artists
  because they told me what they did to get where they did.<br> And at Lake Tahoe it was just a couple weeks of fun with everybody.

      <p>These effected me in different ways, the ending of the year made me feel really good, but also made me realize how close I am to being done with highschool. Quarantine just gave me a time to relax and get ready for the next year.</p>
